# NYC-zip-code-profitability-analysis
Discovering most profitable NYC zip codes for rental estate business, using AirBnB &amp; Zillow data 

We have AirBnb rental listing data in NYC for May 2017 (1, 2 & 3 bed apartment).
Additionally, we have monthly historical real estate data afrom Zillow (2 bed apartment), aggregated by zipcode.
Thus, we need to determine regions/zip codes with least break even time, assuming Zillow estate price as an initial investment while monthly rental income may be estimated from AirBnB listings.
